# HeapSortImplementation
Implemented my own version of the heap sorting algorithm to compare to the time complexity of Javaâ€™s own Arrays.sort() java.utils.Arrays class, which uses various combinations of Quicksort and Mergesort. Final conclusions and time complexities of the project are noted within the comments of the code aswell as the report.
